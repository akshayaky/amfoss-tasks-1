# amfoss-tasks 📝⏳

The tasks helped me to learn and gain knpwledge on computer programming. Apart from this I even learnt the correct and effective way of gaining required information. 
I faced few challenges while doing some tasks, but had them resolved with the help of seniors guidance and google.

Though I couldn't complete all the given tasks as I am completely new to programming, I learnt and tried to cultivate programming skills and computational thinking.
Overall, I had a great learning experience and also enjoyed doing the tasks!
