I want to acquire and accomplish my dreams, and amFOSS would be the right platform to achieve them.
Whenever I learn something new, I always try to put my theoretical knowledge into practical.
Basically, I am from a non-CS background, but I am pretty good at math. I can assure you that I will put all my efforts in learning and become capable of competing and facing any challenge in the future.
