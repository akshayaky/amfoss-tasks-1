# Installation of Ubuntu
## 5 reasons why Linux ?üíª
### 1. High securityüîê
Linux is less vulnerable to threats and different types of attacks (hacks) over 'Windows OS'.
When you have Windows installed, you need to download/purchase an Antivirus program to keep your computer safe from hackers and malware. However, Linux does not require the use of such Anti-Virus programs. Of course, a couple of software tools still exist to help you keep your system free from threats, but it is often unnecessary when you have a Linux system.
### 2. Open source
The aspect that makes linux different from other operating systems is that it falls under FOSS(Free and open source software) i.e., it's source code is freely available.
The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not possible in other OSs.
### 3. Runs on any hardware
With 'Linux', you could even utilize one of your oldest computer systems to achieve a task. However, that does not mean that every Linux distribution would work with 256 MB of RAM coupled with an outdated processor. However, there are options which you can install on such low-end systems as well (such as Puppy Linux).Whereas windows requires a higher hardware configuration (minimum hardware requirements) in order to support different updates.
### 4.Customisation
One major advantage of using Linux is 'customization'. 'Linux' is perfect tewaking system‚Äôs looks. There are numerous choices for wallpapers, desktop icons and panels. 
For any task, right from the GUI interface and file managers, to DVD burners and browsers, around four to six options are available for any particular software. The Linux versions of most popular browsers are also available.
### 5. Great community support
There's no need of hiring any expert while facing issues or threats. We can find solutions of the threats just by a web search, or post it to let others solve the problem. A reply with a detailed explanation of the solution is given that resolves a problem at completely no cost!
